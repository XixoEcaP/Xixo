    ðŸŽ¸ By day, I excelled in management and customer support, ensuring smooth operations for a programming bootcamp. As the sun set, I transformed into a dedicated musician, playing bass and performing with my band.

<p>
    With a background in managing customer support and a knack for problem-solving and communication, I decided to take on a new challenge. After completing a programming bootcamp myself, I am now looking to transition into a career in development.
</p>
<p>
    Equipped with hands-on coding experience and a strong foundation in business acumen, I'm eager to bring my unique skills to the tech world.
